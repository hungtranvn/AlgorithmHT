/*
You have been given a Tree consisting of N nodes. A tree is a fully-connected graph consisting of N nodes and edges. 
The nodes in this tree are indexed from 1 to N. Consider node indexed 1 to be the root node of this tree.
The root node lies at level one in the tree.
You shall be given the tree and a single integer x.
You need to find out the number of nodes lying on level x.

Input Format
The first line consists of a single integer N denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next lines consists of 2 integers a and b denoting an undirected edge between node a and node b.
The next line consists of a single integer x.

Output Format
You need to print a single integers denoting the number of nodes on level x.
