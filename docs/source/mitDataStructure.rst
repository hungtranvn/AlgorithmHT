Data Structures
===============

*************************
Data Structure Interfaces
*************************
* A data structure is a way to store data, with algorithms that support operations on the data.
* Collection of supported operations is called an interface (also API or ADT)
* Interface is a specification: what operations are supported (the problem!)
* Data structure is a representation: how operations are supported (the solution!)
* Two main interfaces: Sequence and Set
